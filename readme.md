# Homomorphic CP Tensor Dcomposition & Tensor Neural Network 

This github is mainly composed of the following two parts:

1.Code for a tensor mining method using cp_decomposition and homomorphic encryption,which applies to 3D-tensor genetics dataset.
2.

## File directory
>homo_test.py----------homomorphic encryption example(the size of test tensor is [300,300,300])

>TensorAlgebra.py--------an improved cp_decomposition method
