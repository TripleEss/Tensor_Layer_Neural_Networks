# Homomorphic CP Tensor Dcomposition & Tensor Neural Network 

This github is mainly composed of the following two parts:

1.Code for a tensor mining method using cp_decomposition and homomorphic encryption,which applies to 3D-tensor genetics dataset.

2.Code for tensor neural network, including traditional matrix type and 3D-tensor ones.
